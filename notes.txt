Linux kernel and driver functions have changed over time breaking much
of the example code.

Firefox LinuxDriverDev->KernelInfo has information on some of the changes.

Also it seems the cleaner way to init modules is more like
this. Functions have specific special modifiers __init and
__exit. Also the function returns are different. See simple for older
example that works but seems touchy and does not work in all cases.

#include <linux/init.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>

static int __init hello_init(void) { return 0; }
static void __exit hello_exit(void) {}

module_init(hello_init);
module_exit(hello_exit);
